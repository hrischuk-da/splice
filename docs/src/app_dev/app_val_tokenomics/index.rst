Tokenomics Overview
===================

Following is an overview of the application and validator tokenomics for
application developers or validator operators. It builds on the "`Canton
Coin: A Canton-Network-native payment
application <https://www.digitalasset.com/hubfs/Canton%20Network%20Files/Documents%20(whitepapers%2c%20etc...)/Canton%20Coin_%20A%20Canton-Network-native%20payment%20application.pdf?__hstc=169870847.16854726061d8b28be85af48c17588c4.1750870506327.1750870506327.1750870506327.1&__hssc=169870847.1.1750870506328&__hsfp=1243925796&_gl=1*1fkzmuj*_gcl_au*MTkyOTE1NjAyNC4xNzUwODcwNTA2*_ga*NDU1NzM2NzgyLjE3NTA4NzA1MDY.*_ga_GVK9ZHZSMR*czE3NTA4NzA1MDUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NzA1MDUkajYwJGwwJGgw>`__"
whitepaper and assumes you have read the whitepaper. The content below
is current as of Splice 0.4.x.

Canton Network tokenomics is based on an *Activity Record* which
identifies a party that performed an action which provides value to the
network. Creating an activity record and minting the associated Canton
Coin (CC) are two distinct steps. The creation and minting steps are
performed in a cycle that is called a *round* which has five phases. In
the first phase, the fee values for that round are written to the ledger
(the fees can be obtained from the `Scan State
API <https://docs.sync.global/app_dev/scan_api/scan_current_state_api.html>`__).
The second phase is called the *activity summary* and it is when
activity records are created. The next phase calculates a *minting
weight* for each kind of activity record which is the share of total CC
that can be minted for this type of activity record. This is followed by
a *minting phase* that uses the activity record and its minting weight
to mint CC for each activity record. There are several rounds active
concurrently with each round being in a different phase. A round starts
every 10 minutes; the SVs can change this in the future. See the CC
whitepaper for the details.

There are five key templates involved in the tokenomics:

-  Two templates are application related:

      - `FeaturedAppActivityMarker <https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/api/splice-amulet/Splice-Amulet.html#type-splice-amulet-featuredappactivitymarker-16451>`__

      - `AppRewardCoupon <https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/api/splice-amulet/Splice-Amulet.html#type-splice-amulet-apprewardcoupon-57229>`__

-  Three templates relate to providing the resources for the activity:

      - `ValidatorRewardCoupon <https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/api/splice-amulet/Splice-Amulet.html#type-splice-amulet-validatorrewardcoupon-76808>`__

      - `ValidatorLivenessActivityRecord <https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/api/splice-amulet/Splice-ValidatorLicense.html#type-splice-validatorlicense-validatorlivenessactivityrecord-17293>`__

      - `SvRewardCoupon <https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/api/splice-amulet/Splice-Amulet.html#type-splice-amulet-svrewardcoupon-68580>`__

The last four are activity records. The ``FeaturedAppActivityMarker``,
``AppRewardCoupon``, and ``ValidatorRewardCoupon`` contracts are created when an
application's transaction succeeds. As discussed later, a
``FeaturedAppActivityMarker`` is converted into an ``AppRewardCoupon`` via
automation.

There is no difference in activity record creation for an `external
party <https://docs.digitalasset.com/build/3.3/tutorials/app-dev/external_signing_onboarding.html#tutorial-onboard-external-party>`__
or local party but there is a difference in the automation support used
in the minting phase. For local parties onboarded to a validator, the
validator application runs background automation to mint all activity
records automatically. An external party signs transactions using a key
they control. As a consequence, the validator automation is not able to
perform external party minting. For external parties, automation needs
to be developed to call ``AmuletRules_Transfer`` at least once per round
with all activity records as inputs.

Aside from the minting weight, an application's reward also depends on
whether it is designated as *featured* or *unfeatured* (the default
state). An unfeatured application receives a smaller reward and has a
lower cap on the amount it can mint. A featured application receives
larger rewards and has a higher cap. A *featured application* also
receives an additional minting weight with a total equivalent value to
$1 US (the SuperValidators may adjust this in the future). To become a
featured application you need an *application provider's party ID* which
is an input to the application. That process starts by filling in `this
form <https://sync.global/featured-app-request/>`__. The request goes to
the tokenomics committee who reviews the application and responds to it.
This `webpage <https://lists.sync.global/g/tokenomics/topics>`__ lists
the tokenomics committees topics for tracking. Hereâ€™s an `example of a
successful
submission <https://lists.sync.global/g/tokenomics/topic/new_featured_app_request/112787885>`__.
Note that, for testing purposes, you can self-feature your application
on DevNet.

For some of the templates, the CC that can be minted can be shared
across multiple parties. For example, a featured application reward can
be shared between the application provider and application user, based
on a given ``weight`` for each. The general pattern for this is:

-  A list of beneficiaries, each with a ``weight``, is provided. The weights  sum up to ``1.0``.

-  Later processing creates a separate contract for each beneficiary and weight pair,
   setting the contract's ``beneficiary`` and ``weight`` fields accordingly.

More detail is provided in the following sections.
